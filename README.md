<h1> Heart Disease Prediction </h1>
<h4> Guru|Ajay|Vikram </h4>

  <h3> Problem Statement </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Nearly 17.5 million deaths from cardiovascular disease occur worldwide.</li> 
    <li>India has more than 30 million heart patients.</li>
<li>In the healthcare industry, large amounts of data are frequently generated. However, it is often not used effectively. </li>
<li>The data indicates that the generated image, sound, text, or file has some hidden patterns and their relationships.</li> 
<li>Tools used to extract knowledge from these databases for clinical diagnosis of disease or other purposes are less common. The accuracy of various algorithms is measured and the algorithms were compared. </li>
    </ul>
  <h3> Algorithms Compared </h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Logistic regression</li>
<li>Nearest neighbor classifier</li>
<li>Support vector machines (SVM)</li>
<li>Boosted Decision Trees</li>
<li>Random Forests</li>
  </ul>
  <h3> Scope : </h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Early disease detection</li>
<li>Patient care and community services</li>
<li>Cuts Medical Cost.</li>
  </ul>
    Hence, our ML Web-Application aims to thus reduce the cost incurred by this preventable disease by predicting the outcome based on the datasets given and training an ML model for an Accurate prediction
